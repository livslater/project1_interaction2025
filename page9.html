            <span class="strong">Popper contrasted these theories</span> against Relativity, which made specific, verifiable predictions, giving the conditions under which the predictions could be shown false.<a href="page10.html" class="sup">10</a> To this day, physicists seek to figure out where Relativity breaks down in order to come to a more fundamental understanding of physical reality. And while the theory may eventually be proven incomplete or a special case of a more general phenomenon, it has still made accurate, testable predictions that have led to practical breakthroughs.
            <br>
            Thus, in Popper’s words, science requires testability: “If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted.”  This means a good theory must have an element of risk to it. It must be able to be proven wrong under stated conditions.<a href="page11.html" class="sup">11</a>
