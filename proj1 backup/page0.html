            <span class="strong">It’s not immediately clear to</span> the layman what the essential difference is between science and something masquerading as science: pseudoscience.<a href="page1.html" class="sup">1</a> The distinction between the two is at the core of what comprises human knowledge: How do we actually know something to be true?
            <br>
            Sir Karl Popper (1902-1994), the scientific philosopher, was interested in the same problem. How do we actually define the scientific process? How do we know which theories can be said to be truly explanatory?
            <br>

            ‘When I received the list of participants in this course and realized that I had been asked to speak to philosophical colleagues I thought, after some hesitation and consultation, that you would probably prefer me to speak about those problems which interest me most, and about those developments with which I am most intimately acquainted. I therefore decided to do what I have never done before: to give you a report on my own work in the philosophy of science, since the autumn of 1919 when I first began to grapple with the problem, ‘When should a theory be ranked as scientific?’<a href="page2.html" class="sup">2</a> or ‘Is there a criterion for the scientific character or status of a theory?’<a href="page3.html" class="sup">3</a>
