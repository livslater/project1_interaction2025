            <span class="strong">‘My mind seems to have</span> become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large collections of facts.’
            <br> <br>
            This is a popularly accepted notion. We observe, observe, and observe, and we look for theories to best explain the mass of facts.<a href="page4.html" class="sup">4</a>

            The problem, as Popper saw it, is that some bodies of knowledge, more properly named pseudoscience, would be considered scientific if the “Observe & Deduce” operating definition were left alone. For example, a believing astrologist<a href="https://niac2505.github.io/astrology_email_main/index.html" class="sup">*</a> can ably provide you with “evidence” that their theories are sound. The biographical information of a great many people can be explained this way, they’d say.
            <br>
            The astrologist would tell you, for example, about how “Leos” seek to be the centre of attention; ambitious, strong, seeking the limelight. As proof, they might follow up with a host of real-life Leos: World-leaders, celebrities, politicians, and so on. In some sense, the theory would hold up. The observations could be explained by the theory, which is how science works, right?<a href="page5.html" class="sup">5</a> What made Popper uncomfortable were comparisons between the two. Why did he feel so uneasy putting Marxist theories and Freudian psychology in the same category of knowledge as Einstein’s Relativity? Did all three not have vast explanatory power in the world? Each theory’s proponents certainly believed so, but Popper was not satisfied.<a href="page6.html" class="sup">6</a>
